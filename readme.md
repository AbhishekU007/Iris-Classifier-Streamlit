# Iris Flower Classification

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset

The project uses the classic [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), which contains 150 samples with four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction for new samples

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Modify `main.py` to experiment with different models or parameters.
- Use the provided functions to predict the species of new iris samples.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy on the test set. See the output in the console for detailed metrics.
